        "1.  **Fully English knowledge triples** – human-readable, one per FAISS vector, generated using a robust `deep_translator` process with caching and fallbacks.\n",

        "3.  **A RAG demo** – answering questions using a language model (DeepSeek-7B) augmented with retrieved knowledge graph triples.\n",
        "4.  **An evaluation** – comparing model performance with and without RAG using keyword-based metrics.\n",

        "*   **Refactored Translation:** The translation process now uses the `deep_translator` library with Google Translate and MyMemory fallbacks, incorporating in-memory caching and retry logic with exponential backoff for improved speed and reliability, especially when dealing with API rate limits.\n",

        "    *   Line 11 specifies the device to load the model onto. It checks if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and uses `'cuda'` if it is, otherwise it uses `'cpu'`. This ensures the embedding process can leverage GPU acceleration if available.\n",

It does not fully capture semantic similarity, fluency, correctness of phrasing, or the overall quality of the generated text in the way more sophisticated metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore do.\n",

They provide an initial indication that the RAG system, in this specific setup, did not show a significant improvement over the base model based on this metric.

This provides a clear overview of how the data is organized hierarchically.\n",

It also counts the total number of relations, which represent the knowledge graph triples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it does it:**\n",

        "\n",
        "**Lessons Learned:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Dependency Management is Crucial and Complex:** Pinning library versions is essential for reproducibility and stability, especially in dynamic environments like Colab. However, finding a truly compatible set of dependencies across multiple libraries (like `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `peft`, `accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`, `huggingface_hub`) can be extremely challenging and time-consuming.\n",
        "*   **Persistent Errors Require Systematic Debugging:** The `ModuleNotFoundError` in Cell 4 demonstrated that simple reinstallations are not always sufficient. Debugging required systematically trying different version combinations, understanding the traceback, and considering interactions between multiple libraries.\n",
        "*   **Runtime Restarts Can Solve Stubborn Issues:** For persistent environment-related errors in Colab, a runtime restart is a valuable troubleshooting step that can clear cached states that `%pip install --upgrade` might miss.\n",
        "*   **Translating Structured Data Requires Careful Planning:** When translating data with complex structures (like JSON with nested entities and relations), it's vital to consider which fields need translation and at what granularity, based on the downstream use of the data (e.g., building knowledge graph triples).\n",
        "*   **Robust Translation Handling is Necessary for External APIs:** Relying on external translation APIs requires implementing robust error handling, including retry mechanisms (like exponential backoff) and fallbacks, to deal with rate limits, server errors, and temporary service unavailability.\n",
        "*   **Caching Improves Efficiency with Repeated Data:** For translation tasks, implementing a cache for frequently encountered text snippets significantly reduces redundant API calls and speeds up the process.\n",
        "*   **Parallel Processing Accelerates File-Based Operations:** Utilizing tools like `ThreadPoolExecutor` for tasks involving processing multiple files concurrently (like translation) is crucial for reducing overall execution time.\n",
        "*   **Clear Notebook Structure and Documentation Aid Understanding:** Organizing the notebook into logical cells with clear markdown explanations and comments significantly improves readability and allows others (and myself) to understand the pipeline and reproduce the results.\n",
        "*   **Evaluation Metrics Matter and Have Limitations:** Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics is key to assessing model performance. Simple metrics like keyword overlap can provide a quick overview but have limitations in capturing semantic meaning and fluency. More sophisticated metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, human evaluation) are needed for a comprehensive assessment.\n",
        "*   **RAG Performance Depends on Retrieval Quality and Model Utilization:** The initial evaluation not showing RAG improvement highlights that effective RAG relies on both retrieving truly relevant context *and* the language model effectively using that context rather than relying solely on its internal knowledge.\n",
        "*   **Debugging Takes Time and Patience:** Resolving complex technical issues, especially dependency problems in machine learning environments, often requires significant time, experimentation, and patience.\n",
        "*   **Understanding Error Messages is Key:** Carefully reading and interpreting traceback messages is fundamental to identifying the root cause of errors and guiding troubleshooting efforts.\n",
        "*   **Iterative Development is Effective:** Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable steps (like translation, indexing, retrieval, evaluation) and addressing issues at each stage is an effective development strategy.\n",
        "*   **Community Resources and Documentation are Valuable:** Consulting documentation for libraries like `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, and `deep_translator`, and looking at community forums for similar errors, can provide crucial clues and solutions.\n",
        "*   **Version Compatibility Tools (Less Used Here, But Relevant):** While not extensively used in my interactive debugging, tools like `pipdeptree` or creating isolated environments (like with `venv` or Conda) can sometimes help diagnose and manage complex dependencies more proactively."
